# Unity3D Graphics Capabilities Demo

###### What is it all about?
It is a demo, demonstrating the capabilities of the Unity 3D engine. With the free assets taken from all over the place, this demo shows the graphical capabilities of the engine. You can see this video for yourself: https://youtu.be/pseEbLRX8tE

It took around 7 hours to make the demo.
